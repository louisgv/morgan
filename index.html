			<p>This is a story about a boy named Sharwan Kumar. He lived with his parents in a middle-class village, but his family wasn't rich or even middle-class. He was born to a poor family.</p>
<p>His dad's name was Vishram Kumar. His dad always went to places that he'd never tell his family about. His mom's name was Kamla Kumar. His mom loved him a lot, and was kind to everyone.</p>
<p>All of his family were gifted. He had an older brother named Raju. Sharwan always looked up to Raju and always wanted to spend time with him. Now when I said that Sharwan and his family were gifted, I wasn't lying.</p>
<p>His mom was a talented cook. She was the best in the village, in fact. One time there was a rich man that asked his mom if she could cook for him and his festival of wealthy guests, and so she did. But while his mom kept cooking, Sharwan went exploring. He went to his first Indian carnival alone, and rode the ferris wheel. He had fun.</p>
